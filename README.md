# FairyTale Script

A programming language designed to look like a fairytale! No complicated symbols, just a beautiful story of adventure and friendship!

### Characters
There are no variables in FairyTale, just characters. First, you make a header like this:
```Characters```
Then, add your characters one by one with a dash:
```
- Adam
- James
- Lily
```
There's no way to assign a type to a character.
To set a character, use **became**:  
```Adam became 5```

There are no arrays, only friendships!  
`- 5 Dwarves`  
`- 19 Buddies`

### Dead or Alive
In a story, characters aren't "True" or "False". Logically, the FairyTale equivalent of a bool is dead or alive!   
`James became dead`

### Chapters
To make a funtion, you make a chapter! Just like this:  
`Chapter 1 - Hunble Beginnings`  
The chapters need to have a number, and they have to be in the right order!

 Chapter 1 will automatically start, but the others you gotta call yourself.  
`Chapter 2 happened.`

To make a variable inside a chapter, just introduce a new character:  
`But then they met Cinderella!`

Every good story has a message. To return something, simply write:  
`What did we learn from this? Mikael.`
The rest of the chapter won't be read. Without a message, what's the point? Simply shallow entertainment with no purpose but to distract us from the horrors of life?

A chapter needs to end in a satisfying way:  
`Oh, what could happen next?`

### Dialogue
The magic compiling unicorn sadly can't speak. If you want to print something, a character has to speak:  
`Mark said: "Hey guys! Let's explore that cave."`

### Loops
Fairytales typically have events that repeat. Just write how many times you want it to happen:  
`This happened 10 times:`

But what if you want something to happen an unspecified amount of times? Well, just use **as long as** and the loop will continue while all the conditions are true. 
`This happend as long as Adam was "Hello" and Mike not was dead:`

Want to run a loop for every character in a friendship?
```
When Snow was "white"
For every Dwarf of Dwarves:
Dwarf became "happy"
```

### If Statements
The question isn't **if**, it's ***when***
```
When Romeo was dead, this happened:
Juliet became "sad".
Juliet became dead.
```
You want to write **else**? I only know of ***Otherwise***.
```
When Hansel was "here", this happened:
Narrator said "Hansel for the win!".
Otherwise, when Gretel was "here", this happened:
Narrator said "Gretel is clearly the winner".
Otherwise, this happened:
Narrator said "Where'd they go? DID THEY DIE?".
Hansel became alive.
Gretel became alive.
Narrator said "Ah, there you are!".
```
To write **or**, type |[|]%Â¤ |} followed by TO_OR_STATEMENT.c]x| and then convert it to js++ using...   
Just kidding, it's **or**. And **and**.

### Comments
The magic unicorn is afraid of brackets(Of course). Just put it inside brackets and it will be ignored:   
`(Plot twist goes here)`

### Previous Books
You want to import an entire library? Whoa there, fella. How'd you plan on doing that? You gotta specify books separately!  
`Read these books before you read this!`
Then, just add the books with a dash.
```
- How to Not Die 2
- A Tale of Swords and Blades
- Learning to control yourself: The Ultimate Guide
```

### A Happy Ending
Like any story, your fairytale has to have an ending:  
`And they lived happily ever after!`

### Compiler
You need a magic program called node from the faraway land of nodejs.org.

The magic unicorn will translate your intriguing tale to javasc... Uhm, Unicorn language!

Simply install the compiler with `npm i -g fairytalescript`. The command is `fairytale`. You can use the flags `-s` and `-o` to specify source and output file respectively. If you want the compiler to read your book instantly, you add `-r` to the end of the command. The magic unicorn will take care of the rest!
