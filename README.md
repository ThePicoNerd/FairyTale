# FairyTale

A programming language designed to look like a fairytale! No complicated symbols, just text!

Characters
There are no variables in FairyTale, just characters. First, you make a header like this:
Characters
Then, add your characters one by one with a dash:
- Adam
- James
- Lily
There's no way to assign a type to a character.
To set a character, use became:
Adam became 5

Bools
In a story, characters aren't "True" or "False". Logically, the FairyTale equivalent of a bool is dead or alive!
James became dead

To make a funtion, you make a chapter! Just like this:
Chapter 1 - HelloWorld
The chapters need to have a number, and they have to be in the right order!

Like any story, your fairytale has to have an ending:
And they lived happily ever after!

## Compiler

Simply install the compiler with `npm i -g fairytalescript`. The command is `fairytale`. You can use the flags `-s` and `-o` to specify source and output file respectively. If you want the compiler to read your book instantly, you add `-r` to the end of the command.
